# Motivation

Through responsive web development and modern technology and tools, we hope to make the arts more accessible to everyone and create a platform for creators to express themselves and get rewarded for it. Creators can solidify legacies and make concrete impacts, imprinting their work into the everlasting blockchain, building reputation and sharing their work with the world.

# Aim

We aim to create an accessible platform for creators to mint and list their work as NFTs on the marketplace quickly and easily.
